            <p>I was walking down the streets of the bustling city of Bhopal today. The dust of narrow winding streets, the cry of hawkers along with the smell of biryani and other spices filled the air. Rickshaws and pedestrians weaved through the crowded streets trying to make their way for doing their daily affairs, some stopping by the roadsides to haggle with vendors for prices of daily necessities. People from all walks of life filled the sidewalks. Women dressed in elegant saris and men in both traditional kurta pyjamas and western attire moved with purpose, while children laughed and chased each other in playful abandon. The chatter of conversations in Hindi and regional dialects added to the tapestry of sounds. Jewellery and ivory shops glinted with gold and silver ornaments intricately crafted by local artisans. The sizzling kebabs and gourmet mouth-watering delicacies like sugar syrup dripping mawa batis feasted my eyes and emptied my tummy.</p>

            <p>As I stood on the chowk, while lazily sipping on my Frooti, I noticed an interesting thing that made me think for a time about a moment that transcends time itself. I saw an elderly couple standing with their luggage, a grey suitcase and two duffle bags, waiting for their cab to arrive or were probably crossing the road.</p>

            <img src="https://github.com/saptarshihalder/blog/blob/main/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-26%2000.24.56%20-%20An%20elderly%20Indian%20couple%20seen%20from%20the%20back,%20standing%20close%20together%20while%20holding%20hands,%20waiting%20for%20a%20bus.%20They%20are%20dressed%20in%20traditional%20Indian%20at.png?raw=true" alt="Source: DALLE AI" />

            <p>Their hands were intertwined and clasped together tightly, as if they had travelled not just through cities, but through decades together. The weathered hand of the man and the comparatively strong yet tender hands of his wife conveyed a tale full of joys and sorrows. The luggage they were carrying made me imagine all the sorrows and sufferings they endured and shared together.</p>

            <p>In that instant, I couldn't help but reflect on how rare these kinds of connections are becoming in today's world. In a fast-paced world where we hope for instant gratification, such instances remind me of how much the world has changed in just a few decades. In today's hyper-connected world, where speed and efficiency are celebrated virtues, the art of slowing down often gets overlooked. We feel pressure to hit certain milestones at specific ages. We compare ourselves with people our age or even younger, who appear to be 'ahead' in life. We go to school until we're 21 and are expected to work until 67. In this run for pace, we have lost our mindset to forming bonds, interacting with people and forming relationships with our near and dear ones.</p>

            <p>We often hear stories about people losing interest in their relationships, cheating when things get tough, and obviously the digitalization of our everyday world. Love isn't a feeling that builds overnight; it needs a generous amount of time, wisdom, care and obviously challenges which might be terrible to bear if alone, but a wholesome worthwhile journey when it's with someone. A terrible burden, when shared with someone who has been with you through sunshine and storms, and shared countless moments both big and small, shows something we all must hope to see. You can't be in love with people with whom you have never been friends.</p>

            <p>Maybe it's time we look back at how our parents and grandparents approached love. They didn't swipe right and move on when things got hard. They built lives together, navigated challenges, and held on when the road got rough. They weren't looking for something fleetingâ€”they were looking for something lasting.</p>

            <p>As I kept thinking about these things, I saw a blue Volvo bus arrive on the spot and the couple helped each other to board the bus. Slowly the bus crackled its engines and toddled its way, as the couple began to write a new story together just as they used to write and will write for years before and hence. I too began to walk back to my campus, carrying with me a renewed appreciation for the enduring power of love and connection in our rapidly changing world.</p>
